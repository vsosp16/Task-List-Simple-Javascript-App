# Javascript Tasklist
This is just a fast sample of plain javascript task list.

## Known Issues
-If we try to drag items downwards on mobile browsers like chrome, dragging will stutter. Because it will trigger the browser refresh feature at the same time. This is a known problem of dragula. Nothing about my code. Use another drag and drop library and you will be ok.
